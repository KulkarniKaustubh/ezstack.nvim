# ezstack.nvim

Neovim plugin for [ezstack](https://github.com/KulkarniKaustubh/ezstack) — manage stacked PRs with git worktrees, all without leaving your editor.

## Requirements

- Neovim **0.10+** (uses `vim.system`, `vim.uv`, `vim.json`)
- The [`ezs`](https://github.com/KulkarniKaustubh/ezstack) CLI **v4.7.0 or newer** on `$PATH` (the plugin also probes `~/.local/bin`, `~/go/bin`, `$GOBIN`, `$GOPATH/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`). The plugin calls v4.7-only flags like `--cascade`, `--draft-all`, `goto --search`, `pr stack`, `config export/import`, and `agent prompt --reset/--repo`; older CLIs fail at the call site with cryptic errors. Run `ezs upgrade` to refresh.
- Optional: [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) for fuzzy pickers
- Optional: [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) for auto-refresh on git operations

## Installation

`:Ezs` is registered immediately when the plugin is on the runtimepath, so the plugin works without an explicit `setup()` call. Calling `setup()` is recommended to override defaults.

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  "KulkarniKaustubh/ezstack.nvim",
  cmd = { "Ezs" },                  -- lazy-load on first :Ezs
  keys = { { "<leader>ez", "<cmd>Ezs<cr>", desc = "Ezstack viewer" } },
  config = function()
    require("ezstack").setup()
  end,
}
```

If you use Telescope:

```lua
require("telescope").load_extension("ezstack")
```

### packer.nvim

```lua
use {
  "KulkarniKaustubh/ezstack.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("ezstack").setup()
  end,
}
```

### Manual

Clone the repo and add it to your runtimepath:

```vim
set runtimepath+=/path/to/ezstack.nvim
```

## Configuration

```lua
require("ezstack").setup({
  cli_path = "ezs",             -- path to ezs binary (auto-discovered)
  auto_refresh = true,          -- refresh viewer on FugitiveChanged / EzstackChanged
  viewer_position = "botright", -- split position for viewer
  viewer_height = 15,           -- viewer window height
  statusline_cache_ttl = 5000,  -- statusline cache TTL in milliseconds
  goto_strategy = "tcd",        -- "tcd" (tab-local), "cd" (global), "lcd" (window-local)
  goto_close_buffers = false,   -- close unmodified buffers from old worktree on goto
  goto_open_explorer = true,    -- open file explorer at new worktree root
  default_keymaps = false,      -- install ]s/[s for stack nav (opt-in, never clobbers)
  statusline_format = "stack",  -- "stack" | "pr" | "full"
  welcome = true,               -- show one-time welcome notification on first setup
})
```

## Stack Viewer

The stack viewer (`:Ezs`) shows all stacks in a styled buffer. Branches
are drawn as a `tree(1)`-style hierarchy so siblings off the same parent
line up underneath it — the same shape `:Ezs graph` uses, with the
viewer's PR/CI/diff columns layered on top:

```
 Stack: my-feature [a1b2c3d]                          root: main
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
     ├── feature-1     PR #100 [OPEN]    CI: 3/3     +120 -8   (→ main)
     │   ├── feature-2 PR #101 [DRAFT]   CI: pending +50 -2    (→ feature-1)
   > │   └── feature-3 [no PR]                                  (→ feature-1)
     └── hotfix        PR #110 [OPEN]    CI: 1/1     +12 -3    (→ main)
```

The viewer is non-modifiable; cursor position is preserved across refreshes.

### Viewer Keymaps

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<CR>` | Go to worktree |
| `o` | Open PR in browser |
| `r` | Refresh |
| `R` | Rename stack |
| `n` | New branch |
| `d` | Delete branch under cursor |
| `p` | Push branch under cursor |
| `P` | Push entire stack |
| `s` | Sync (interactive terminal) |
| `c` | Continue an in-progress sync |
| `u` | Update PR for branch under cursor |
| `D` | Diff against parent (terminal) |
| `a` | Open agent (branch- or stack-scoped) |
| `A` | Build feature with agent (prompts for description) |
| `?` | Show keymap help |
| `q` | Close viewer |

## Telescope Integration

```lua
require("telescope").load_extension("ezstack")
```

```vim
:Telescope ezstack branches    " Browse and switch branches
:Telescope ezstack stacks      " Browse and rename stacks
```

### Telescope Keymaps

**Branches picker:**
- Each entry shows branch name, PR number/state, CI summary (when available from `ezs list --json`), and `+adds/-dels` vs parent.
- `<CR>` — go to worktree
- `<C-o>` — open PR in browser
- `<C-d>` — delete branch
- `<C-p>` — push branch

**Stacks picker:**
- `<CR>` — open stack viewer
- `<C-r>` — rename stack

When Telescope is not installed, `:Ezs goto` falls back to `vim.ui.select`.

## Worktree Navigation

`:Ezs goto` switches your Neovim working directory to the selected branch's worktree:

- Uses `:tcd` by default (tab-local — each tab can be a different worktree)
- Fires `User EzstackGoto` autocommand for custom hooks
- Integrates with `nvim-tree`, `neo-tree`, and `oil` file explorers

## Quick Action Menu

`:EzsActions` (also `:Ezs actions`) opens a `vim.ui.select` menu with the most common operations: sync current branch / stack, `sync --continue`, push branch / stack, PR create/update/draft/merge/open/stack, new/delete/goto branch, and `graph`. Bind it if you use it a lot:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>ea", "<cmd>EzsActions<cr>", { desc = "ezstack actions" })
```

## Stack Graph

`:Ezs graph` renders every stack as an ASCII tree in a scratch split. Use it when you want a quick mental model of the stack without the full viewer UI. Press `q` to close.

```
Stack: my-feat [a1b2c3d]  root: main
├──   feat-1  PR #100 [OPEN]
│   └── * feat-2  PR #101 [DRAFT]
└──   feat-3  PR #102 [OPEN]
```

Branches whose `parent` chain does not reach `stack.root` are surfaced under an `(orphans — parent not reachable from root)` subheader rather than silently dropped.

## Default Keymaps

When `default_keymaps = true`, the plugin installs two opt-in normal-mode mappings:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `]s` | `:Ezs down` — navigate toward children |
| `[s` | `:Ezs up` — navigate toward the parent |

We deliberately use `]s`/`[s` (Vim's "next/prev spell error" motions, inert unless `spell` is on) and **never** the built-in motions `gn`/`gp`. The installer checks `maparg()` and refuses to overwrite any mapping you already have, so it is safe to turn on even if you bind `]s` to something else.

## Statusline

```lua
-- lualine example
require("lualine").setup({
  sections = {
    lualine_b = {
      "branch",
      { function() return require("ezstack").statusline() end },
    },
  },
})
```

The `statusline_format` setup option picks what the component returns:

| Value | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `"stack"` *(default)* | ` feature-1 \| my-feature [a1b2c3d]` |
| `"pr"` | ` feature-1 \| PR#42 OPEN` (PR section omitted when there is no PR) |
| `"full"` | ` feature-1 \| my-feature [a1b2c3d] \| PR#42 OPEN` |

Returns `""` when the current buffer is not inside any stack. Results are cached for `statusline_cache_ttl` ms (default 5s) to avoid hammering the CLI.

## Welcome Notification

On the first call to `setup()`, the plugin emits a one-time `vim.notify` pointing at `:Ezs`, `:Ezs graph`, `:Ezs new`, and `:EzsActions`. The idempotency marker lives under `stdpath("state")/ezstack/welcomed` — never under `~/.ezstack` (that directory belongs to the `ezs` CLI). Set `welcome = false` in `setup()` to suppress it entirely.

## Fugitive Integration

When [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) is installed and `auto_refresh = true`, the stack viewer automatically refreshes after fugitive operations (commits, checkouts, rebases).

The plugin also fires its own `User EzstackChanged` autocommand after every CLI mutation it performs (push, sync, delete, ...), so the viewer refreshes itself even without fugitive.

## Autocommands

| Event | Pattern | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `User` | `EzstackSetup` | Fired at the end of `setup()` (useful for test harnesses and deferred wiring) |
| `User` | `EzstackGoto` | Fired after switching worktrees via `:Ezs goto` |
| `User` | `EzstackChanged` | Fired after CLI mutations (sync, delete, etc.) |

## Tests

The plugin ships with a [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) test suite under `tests/`. Run it from the repo root:

```bash
nvim --headless --noplugin \
  -u tests/minimal_init.lua \
  -c "PlenaryBustedDirectory tests/ {minimal_init = 'tests/minimal_init.lua', sequential = true}"
```

`minimal_init.lua` auto-discovers `plenary.nvim` from `vendor/plenary.nvim`, `$EZSTACK_PLENARY`, or common package-manager install paths. The suite covers subcommand-dispatch completeness (every advertised `:Ezs` name has a handler), statusline formatters, graph rendering (including orphans), default-keymap installation, and welcome-marker idempotency.

## Help

Once installed, `:help ezstack` shows the full Vim help file.
